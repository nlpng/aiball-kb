# aiball keyboard
A 42-key splited keyboard inspired by [keyball](https://github.com/Yowkees/keyball) and [roBa](https://github.com/kumamuk-git/roBa), which has feature of trackball and wireless.

# Changes
The keyboard is based on roBa keyboard, and rework to fit my personal needs, since Corne keyboard layout is preferred, the key access feels better and more compact to me.
